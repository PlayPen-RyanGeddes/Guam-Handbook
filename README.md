# GHURA New Tenant Guide
1. GHURA allows landlords to post available units for rent through their free web portal at [ghura.org](https://ghura.org/).  Post your unit here specifying for Section 8 tenants.
2. Before showing unit to prospective tenants, ask if they have a voucher and verify the voucher authorizes the correct number of bedrooms.  Vouchers specify a maximum rent based on authorized bedrooms so it is inefficient to rent a unit with more bedrooms than indicated.  You cannot rent a unit that contains fewer bedrooms than authorized by the tenant voucher.
3. Before meeting with the prospective tenant, prepare your business license, warranty deed, utility bills (power and water), lease agreement and master record.  The master record is a certificate that shows verifies you have an active business license.
4. Meet the prospective tenant at property for tour.  Bring the above paperwork and instruct the tenant to bring their voucher to the meeting.
5. If the tenant agrees to rent, verify their voucher is correct.  Have tenant sign voucher and lease agreement. (If you do not want to rent to this tenant, tell them you already have a voucher from a previously scheduled showing and you will get back to them if it falls through.)
6.  Submit all paperwork to GHURA in person ASAP.  GHURA Sinajana Main Office is located at – 117 Bien Venida Avenue, Sinajana.
7. GHURA will schedule an inspection. [Erica](#ghura-contacts) is in charge of scheduling, it usually takes about 2 weeks.
8. GHURA inspects the following items: ##TODO INSERT INSPECTION ITEMS
9. If you fail, GHURA will generally give you a chance to fix the offending items and send them a photo once repairs have been completed.  If you pass, the inspector will submit paperwork to your tenant's caseworker.
10. Case worker will then schedule a date to sign GHURA contract.
11. At contract signing you and tenant will sign GHURA contract.  Deliver keys to tenant after collecting $1,000 cash security deposit.  GHURA begins remitting rent pro-rated from signing date.
12.  The tenant signs a 12 month lease that auto renews every 12 months.  
13.  If you wish to increase the rent, you must restart this entire process.  See [Adjusting GHURA Rents](#setting-and-adjusting-ghura-rents).
14.  Every two years GHURA will perform a quality of life inspection.  See [GHURA Standards](#ghura-standards)
15. You may not evict a tenant within the first 12 months for any reason.  After first 12 months you must provide 30 days notice.  Easy justifications for eviction are renovations, non-payment of copays, damages, utility abuse.  See [GHURA Eviction Guide](#ghura-eviction-guide)
16. Tenants are responsible for a small co-pay of monthly rent paid via direct deposit.  Instruct them to put their name on deposit slip for accounting.  See [Collection of Rents from Tenants](#collection-of-rents-tenants)

# New Business License Application
This is a guide to applying for a new business license upon acquiring a new property.  As of 2022, it is Kokobird Property policy to hold each property under a separate business license as a sole proprietor.
1. Fill out new Business License Application at Department of Revenue and Tax.  Entrance on unmarked door on right side of large white warehouse at 1240 16, Barrigada, 96913, Guam.  Example Application can be found at [Guam Tax Docs](https://www.govguamdocs.com/revtax/docs/BusinessLicenseApplication.pdf) or saved in kokobird drive.  **You will need to bring a copy of the current deed to property** and complete a Good Moral Character questionnaire, Certificate of Transacting Business under a Fictitious Name (if applicable) and proof of registration with the Department of Revenue & Taxation. DRT will issue a Locator Number on application and indicate 5 required clearances at: Land Management, Public Works Bldg Permit, Guam Fire Department, Real Property Tax Div, and Gross Receipt Tax/Collections.
2. Dept of Land Management must review and clear application **first** before other departments.  DLM located in ITC building on 3rd floor at 590 S Marine Corps Dr, Tamuning, 96913, Guam.  **Carefully review plat number on application as DLM will just stamp your application without reviewing for accuracy.**
3. Public Works, GFD Real Property Tax Division and GRT/Collections clearances can all be obtained at the One Stop Licensing Center at GR33+23Q, Tamuning, 96913, Guam.  All fees are payable to Treasurer of Guam.
